Mindset:

1. What do I need to do? (specific and in detail)
2. Why do I need to do it? (again, specific and in detail)

## How to write great research papers

Generally try to write down every idea you have in a paper.
Start creating the publication immediately and revise the paper as you research.

Imagine explaining your idea to the readers on a whiteboard -- build your paper from this form.

Avoid passive forms like "It can be seen that ..." or "It is concluded that ...".
It is better to use the "we" form (we) -- even if you are the sole author.
Use the "you" form (you) to address the reader directly.
Formulate your sentences in active, e.g., "We have done x tests ..." or "We conclude that ...".
Try to make your formulations as simple as possible -- short sentences.

Start immediately with writing.
Have an idea and start with writing.
Then, use the paper as a foundation to work with
Writing a paper is not just to report anything, it's actually the primary mechanism to do research!
Start writing a paper about any idea, no matter how stupid or insignificant it would be.
Sometimes, something boring will turn into something really interesting - not always, but sometimes :)

Try to infect the readers mind with your idea.
That's the key! Tell your idea explicitly, don't leave the reader to be a detective to discover your idea and to reverse-engineer - be completely upfront on this.
Write one paper for one idea. 
If it turns out that your paper contains more than one idea, split it up and write e.g. three papers instead of one.

Tell a story in your paper. 
Think about standing in front of a whiteboard and explain your idea to a colleague.
Then, do the same thing in your paper - almost! 

Maybe try following structure:

* Here is a problem
* It's an interesting problem
* It's an unsolved problem
* **Here is my idea**
* My idea works (details, data)
* Here's how my idea compares to other people's approaches

Common structure of a paper:

* Title
* Abstract (4 sentences)
* Introduction (1 page)
* The problem (1 page)
* My idea (2 pages)
* The details (5 pages)
* Related work (1-2 pages)
* Conclusions and further work (0.5 pages)

## Abstract

Four sentences/paragraphs (Kent Beck):

1. What's the problem?
2. Why it is an interesting problem?
3. What's our solution for the problem?
4. What can be done with the solution?

## Nail your contributions: Introduction

Describe the problem and state your contribution, e.g. describe it with an example to introduce your problem.
Quickly show how my paper will fix the problem.
While clearly state your contributions, use forward references to the evidences.
Think of like the introduction is the "specification" and the rest is the "implementation".

Try out the following structure:

* What is the hypothesis?
* What is the output of the paper?
* What will be learned?
* What will we learn that we did not know before?
* What is the relevance of what will be discovered?
* What do we want to prove?

## Conclusion

* The most important solutions and the findings derived from them
* What of the result is essential of it?
* What was new?
* What has to be done?
* What is still open or unknown?

## Related work

A lot of paper put the related work at the beginning, because most of our idea are based on other ideas and that would actually be the natural way how to describe your research.
The problem of this approach is that the related work part at the beginning could work like barrier to your idea.
This does not mean that you should save all stuff about the related till the end.
Think again how you would explain your idea on a **whiteboard**.
So, you would probably show your idea based on a example and note that a specific part comes from one guy but you added something cool to be better in another context.
By meaning, you cite the stuff from other while explaining your idea.
In addition, if you did find a paper inspiring, mention it and explain why. 
Means, that giving credits to others does not diminish the credit you get from your paper.
